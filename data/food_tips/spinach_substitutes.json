    {"name": "Kale", "details": "Sturdier, slightly bitter. Great for sauteing or soups. Chop and lightly cook when substituting in pasta dishes."},
    {"name": "Swiss chard", "details": "Milder, tender. Works well in most spinach recipes. Use chopped leaves and tender stems."},
    {"name": "Arugula", "details": "Peppery flavor. Best for salads or light cooking. Add right at the end to wilt when used in pasta."},
    {"name": "Baby bok choy", "details": "Mild flavor. Works in stir-fries and soups. Chop and saute when substituting."},
    {"name": "Collard greens", "details": "Hearty texture. Great for cooked dishes but not ideal for raw applications."},
    {"name": "Romaine or butter lettuce", "details": "Works for raw dishes only. Lacks spinach's texture when cooked."}
