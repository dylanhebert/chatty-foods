  "directions": [
    "Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature while prepping.",
    "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.",
    "Sear chicken thighs about 5 minutes per side until golden. Remove and set aside.",
    "In the same pan, add sliced onion and green bell pepper. Cook 2-3 minutes.",
    "Add green beans to the pan with the onion and pepper. Season with salt, pepper, and optional smoked paprika or thyme.",
    "If green beans are crowded, cover the pan for 3-4 minutes to steam, then uncover and cook 4-5 more minutes, stirring frequently. If no lid, add a splash of water or wine and cook uncovered 8-10 minutes until tender-crisp.",
    "Once green beans are tender (deep vibrant green, slight snap when bitten, fork pierces easily), stir in garlic.",
    "Pour in white wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up browned bits.",
    "Stir in fig balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, and honey. Let simmer 1-2 minutes to thicken slightly.",
    "Return chicken to the skillet. Spoon sauce over the thighs. Cover and simmer 10-12 minutes until chicken is cooked through and glazed.",
    "Uncover last 2-3 minutes if you want the sauce thicker.",
    "Serve over white rice. Optionally garnish with red pepper flakes, crushed nuts (walnuts or pecans), or a drizzle of extra fig balsamic."

  "notes": "Serve over white rice for best results. If using 1 lb of green beans and they cannot lay flat, cover with a lid, foil, baking sheet, or cook uncovered with a splash of water at medium heat. Green beans are done when they have a deep vibrant green color with slight snap and slight blistering. Adding a splash of white wine to rice while cooking ties the flavors together. Can also be served with mashed potatoes or crusty bread.",
