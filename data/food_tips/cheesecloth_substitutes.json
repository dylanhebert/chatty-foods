    {"name": "Clean thin dish towel", "details": "Works well for straining. Hold over a strainer and wring out tightly."},
    {"name": "Clean T-shirt", "details": "A clean cotton T-shirt can substitute when other options are unavailable."},
    {"name": "Coffee filter", "details": "Can work but may be too thick/slow for some applications like syrups."}
