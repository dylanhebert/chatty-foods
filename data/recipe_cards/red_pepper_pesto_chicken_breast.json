  "directions": [
    "Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and smoked paprika.",
    "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.",
    "Sear chicken breasts until browned on both sides.",
    "Lower heat, spoon in the red pepper pesto (about half the jar), and add 2-3 tbsp water or chicken broth to loosen into a sauce.",
    "Simmer 5-7 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and coated in a thick, glossy sauce.",
    "Serve with mashed potatoes and corn, spooning extra sauce over the mashed potatoes."
  ],
  "notes": "For 1.5 lb of chicken, start with half the jar of pesto. Use 2/3 of the jar if you want it extra saucy for mashed potatoes. Alternative seasoning: Italian seasoning with a tiny bit of crushed red pepper instead of smoked paprika. The sauce works like a creamy red pepper gravy over mashed potatoes. Sprinkle mashed potatoes with parsley or chives for freshness.",
