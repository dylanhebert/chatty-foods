    {"name": "Base ratio", "details": "Use 1:1 ratio (equal parts sweetener and water) for thinner syrups, or 2:1 (double sweetener to water) for thicker syrups."},
    {"name": "Heating temperature", "details": "Heat to 190-200F (88-93C), just below boiling. Avoid boiling to prevent crystallization or flavor alteration."},
    {"name": "Flavoring agents", "details": "Use concentrated flavoring agents (extracts, spices, fruit zest) sparingly. Strain thoroughly to remove solids."},
    {"name": "Viscosity check", "details": "When cooled, syrup should flow easily but coat the back of a spoon without being overly runny."},
    {"name": "Preservation", "details": "Add a splash of lemon juice (1 tsp per cup) or vodka (1 tbsp per cup) for longer shelf life."},
    {"name": "Storage", "details": "Store in airtight glass containers in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Let cool to room temperature before refrigerating."},
    {"name": "Cooling process", "details": "Pour into bottle while still warm for easier handling. Leave uncovered or loosely capped to cool completely, then seal tightly."},
    {"name": "Sweetener options", "details": "White/brown/raw sugar, honey, maple syrup, agave nectar, coconut sugar, date syrup are all viable bases."},
    {"name": "Latte dosage", "details": "For a 36g espresso shot, start with 1-2 tbsp of syrup and adjust to taste."}

  "notes": "These baseline practices ensure consistent viscosity and flavor concentration across different syrup experiments. Add vanilla extract after removing from heat to preserve its aroma. Syrups naturally thicken as they cool.",
