  "directions": [
    "In a small saucepan, whisk together sugar, cocoa powder, and ground cinnamon.",
    "Add water and stir well to create a smooth mixture.",
    "Simmer on low-medium heat, stirring frequently, until everything is dissolved (about 5 minutes).",
    "Strain through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth if the cinnamon makes the syrup slightly gritty.",
    "Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract.",
    "Let cool before transferring to a syrup bottle. Store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks."
  ],
  "notes": "Ground cinnamon works but may cause slight grittiness - strain well or use a cinnamon stick instead for a smoother result. If cocoa powder doesn't fully dissolve, whisk vigorously while heating or blend after cooking. Pairs well with lattes, Mexican mochas, and hot cocoa.",
