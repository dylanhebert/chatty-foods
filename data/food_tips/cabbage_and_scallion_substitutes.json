    {"name": "Red cabbage -> Green cabbage", "details": "Closest match. Slightly milder and paler but works well raw or sauteed."},
    {"name": "Red cabbage -> Napa cabbage", "details": "Softer, sweeter, and wilts faster. Good for stir-fries or when you want less crunch."},
    {"name": "Red cabbage -> Kale (thinly sliced)", "details": "Heavier and earthier, but works in cooked dishes."},
    {"name": "Red cabbage -> Shredded carrots", "details": "Adds color and crunch. Not the same flavor but works in a pinch."},
    {"name": "Scallions -> Chives", "details": "Closest flavor match for raw use, though milder."},
    {"name": "Scallions -> Shallots or red onion (thinly sliced)", "details": "More pungent, use sparingly or quick-pickle to mellow."},
    {"name": "Scallions -> Leeks (light green/white part)", "details": "Milder onion flavor, better cooked than raw."},
    {"name": "Scallions -> Garlic chives", "details": "Great substitute with a slightly more garlicky note."}
