  "directions": [
    "Toss raw chicken tenders with 3 tbsp peri-peri sauce, 1 tbsp spicy honey, salt, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and black pepper.",
    "Let marinate for 15-30 minutes (optional but worth it).",
    "Air fry at 375°F for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through, until crispy and cooked through (165°F internal temp).",
    "After cooking, brush lightly with extra peri-peri sauce and drizzle with spicy honey for a glossy, spicy-sweet finish."
  ],
  "notes": "Pairs perfectly with rosemary red potatoes and roasted carrots. The slight sweetness plays off earthy sides beautifully. An alternative sweet and savory route uses 1 tbsp Spicy Honey + 1 tbsp Strawberry Jalapeno Jam + a dash of balsamic fig vinegar as a glaze brushed on after air frying. Skip Red Pepper Almond Pesto and Pomegranate Fermented Pepper for this dish - they work better as dips or pasta sauces.",
