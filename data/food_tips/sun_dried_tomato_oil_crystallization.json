    {"name": "Cause of yellowish clumps", "details": "The yellowish-orange clumps on refrigerated sun-dried tomatoes are solidified olive oil or vegetable oil, not mold. This happens when the jar is stored in a cold environment."},
    {"name": "Safety check - smell", "details": "If it still smells tomatoey and savory (not sour, rancid, or musty), it is likely safe."},
    {"name": "Safety check - appearance", "details": "Tomatoes should still be red and flexible or slightly chewy. If you see white fuzz, gray mold, or a sour smell, toss the jar."},
    {"name": "Fix - room temperature", "details": "Leave the jar at room temperature for 15-30 minutes and the oil will liquefy again."},
    {"name": "Fix - warm water bath", "details": "To speed up the process, place the jar in a bowl of warm water for 5-10 minutes."}

  "notes": "This is a common concern but almost always harmless. Cold oil solidification is normal and does not indicate spoilage. Only discard if there is white fuzz, gray mold, or a sour/rancid smell.",
