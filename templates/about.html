        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">The problem</h2>
        <p>
            I use AI a lot in the kitchen. It helps me come up with recipes based on whatever ingredients
            I have on hand, suggests pairings, walks me through techniques, and generally makes cooking
            more fun. Over time, I built up a solid collection of recipes and tips through those conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem is that all of that useful information gets buried. Even with a dedicated project
            in the app, good recipes and tips end up scattered across dozens of conversations. Finding that
            one chicken thigh glaze from three weeks ago means scrolling through a lot of unrelated chatter.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted a clean way to reference everything I've cooked and learned without digging through
            old conversations, and an easy way to keep adding to it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white pt-2">The process</h2>
        <p>
            The idea for how to actually pull this off came to me in the shower. The steps ended up being
            pretty straightforward:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
            <li>Export my ChatGPT conversation data</li>
            <li>Write a script to organize the raw export into individual conversation files</li>
            <li>Have Claude read through all of them and flag the ones related to food</li>
            <li>From those food conversations, extract structured recipe cards and food tips</li>
            <li>Use that structured data as the foundation for this site</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Now when I cook something new with AI, I just drop the conversation in and the recipes and
            tips get added to the collection.
