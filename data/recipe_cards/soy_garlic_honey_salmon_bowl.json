    "Mix soy sauce, honey, olive oil, minced garlic, black pepper, and optional chili flakes in a small bowl. Brush all over the salmon.",
    "For oven method: Preheat to 425F. Line a baking tray with foil. Place salmon skin-side down, pour any leftover marinade on top. Bake 10-12 minutes until the thickest part flakes but is still glossy inside. Optionally broil for the last 1 minute for char.",
    "For pan-sear method: Heat a pan with a thin layer of oil over medium-high. Sear salmon skin-side down for about 4 minutes. Flip, drop heat to medium, spoon leftover marinade on top, cook 2-3 more minutes.",
    "Saute vegetables with salt, pepper, and a splash of soy sauce.",
    "Assemble bowl: Rice on the bottom, top with warm sauteed veggies, then flake salmon into chunks on top.",
    "Drizzle with sriracha mayo. Garnish with sesame seeds, green onion, and a squeeze of lime."

  "notes": "The soy-garlic-honey-chili seasoning profile pairs perfectly with sriracha mayo and vegetables. Two cooking methods offered: oven (425F, 10-12 min) or pan-sear (quicker, crispier). For extra punch, a spicy glaze can be added.",
