  "directions": [
    "Bring 190ml of water to a boil in a small pot. Add a pinch of salt.",
    "In a separate pan, melt butter over low heat. Add minced garlic and saute for 30 seconds until fragrant.",
    "Pour the boiling water over the couscous in a heatproof bowl. Cover and let sit for 5 minutes.",
    "Uncover and fluff the couscous with a fork to separate the grains (do not use a spoon as it can mash the grains).",
    "Stir in the melted garlic butter, paprika, cumin, black pepper, and lemon zest.",
    "Mix in parsley and red pepper flakes if using. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.",
    "Serve warm."
  ],
  "notes": "Fluffing means gently separating the grains with a fork after steaming to make them light and airy. Pairs excellently with stovetop chicken and lemony carrots. For 2-3 servings, scale down to 140g couscous, 140ml water, 1.5 tbsp butter. Adjust salt if using salted butter.",
