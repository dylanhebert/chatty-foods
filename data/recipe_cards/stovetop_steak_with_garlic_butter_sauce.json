  "directions": [
    "Take steaks out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking to bring to room temperature.",
    "Preheat grill pan over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes until very hot.",
    "Lightly brush the grill pan with high-smoke point oil.",
    "Sear steaks for 3-4 minutes on one side without moving them.",
    "Flip and sear for another 3-4 minutes on the other side.",
    "For thick steaks (1.5-2 inches): after searing both sides, lower heat to medium-low. Continue cooking 4-6 minutes per side for medium-rare, 6-8 minutes per side for medium. Flip every 2-3 minutes to prevent burning.",
    "Check internal temperature: Rare 120-125F, Medium-Rare 130-135F, Medium 140-145F, Medium-Well 150-155F.",
    "Transfer steaks to a plate and rest for 5-10 minutes.",
    "For the garlic butter sauce: melt 6 tbsp butter in a small pan, add garlic powder, season with salt and pepper. Pour over steaks."
  ],
  "notes": "For grill marks, rotate steaks 45 degrees halfway through searing each side. If finishing thick steaks in the oven at 400F, pull them 10-15F below target temp as they will continue to rise while resting. For medium-rare, pull at 115-120F. The quick garlic butter sauce (butter + garlic powder + salt and pepper) is the fastest option. For a richer pan sauce, deglaze the pan with beef broth, add garlic, butter, and Worcestershire sauce. Avocado oil is recommended over olive oil for the high-heat searing.",
