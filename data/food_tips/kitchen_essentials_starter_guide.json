      "name": "Chef's knife recommendation",
      "details": "Miyabi Hibana or Miyabi Artisan 8-inch Gyuto chef's knife. Gyuto means 'cow sword' and is the Japanese equivalent of a chef's knife -- thinner, sharper edge ground at ~15 degrees. The 180mm (7 inch) size is the sweet spot for most home cooks."
    },
    {
      "name": "Cutting board recommendation",
      "details": "John Boos black walnut end-grain board, 18-20 inches wide, 1.5-2 inches thick. Walnut is easier on knife edges than maple and ages beautifully. Oil with food-safe mineral oil every few uses."
    },
    {
      "name": "Stainless steel skillet",
      "details": "All-Clad D5 (5-ply) 12-inch stainless steel skillet. D5 has better heat distribution and fewer hot spots than D3 (3-ply). 12 inches is better than 10 for searing, browning, and one-pan dinners. A skillet is more versatile than a saute pan for everyday cooking."
    },
    {
      "name": "Wooden utensils (3 essentials)",
      "details": "1) Flat wooden spatula/turner for flipping and scraping. 2) Wooden saute spoon (oval/rounded) for stirring and sauces. 3) Wooden spoon with deeper bowl for soups, stews, and pasta. Black walnut or olivewood recommended."
    },
    {
      "name": "Knife storage",
      "details": "Magnetic knife block or wall-mounted magnetic strip. Better than traditional blocks because: no slots to dull blade, faster access, easier to clean. Place near prep area, not stove."
    },
    {
      "name": "Knife maintenance",
      "details": "Get a medium-grit ceramic honing rod (800-1200 grit) for routine edge maintenance. Use 5-8 strokes per side at 15-20 degree angle before or after cooking. For actual sharpening, a 1000/3000 grit whetstone combo is the best long-term investment."
    },
    {
      "name": "Wooden utensil care",
      "details": "Hand-wash only with warm water and mild soap, dry immediately. Oil with food-safe mineral oil every 1-2 months. Never dishwasher or soak."
    },
    {
      "name": "Future upgrades (4-6 months later)",
      "details": "2-3 qt stainless saucepan, paring knife, rimmed sheet pans for roasting/baking, lid set for pans, larger stockpot."
    }
  ],
  "notes": "Start with 3 foundational pieces: knife + cutting board + stainless steel skillet. These cover 90% of everyday cooking needs. Buy quality pieces that last rather than sets. Add wooden utensils as an immediate complement. Build up over time rather than buying everything at once.",
