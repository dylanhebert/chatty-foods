    {"name": "Eggs per omelette", "details": "2 eggs is the standard baseline. Use 3 eggs for a larger, fluffier, more filling omelette. Use 1 egg only if adding a lot of fillings or doing a thin French-style one."},
    {"name": "Butter goes in the pan, not the eggs", "details": "Do not mix butter into the egg base. Beat eggs with salt (and optionally a splash of water or milk for softer eggs). Heat the pan, add butter, and pour in the eggs when the butter melts and stops foaming."},
    {"name": "Why not butter in the eggs", "details": "Butter mixed into the eggs makes the texture greasy. Butter in the pan controls heat and prevents sticking, giving better curds and cleaner flavor."},
    {"name": "For richer eggs", "details": "Add cream or milk to the egg mixture, not butter."}
  ],
  "notes": "If cooking the omelette as a standalone meal, go with 3 eggs. If pairing with toast, potatoes, or veggies, 2 eggs is the right portion.",
