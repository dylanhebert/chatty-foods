    "Combine garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, dried thyme, and cayenne into a rub. Season chicken on both sides.",
    "Sear chicken in a hot pan until cooked through. Remove from pan and set aside.",
    "Add minced shallots or garlic cloves to the pan and saute briefly.",
    "Deglaze with 1/2 cup sweet cherry wine, scraping up the brown bits. Let reduce by half or more (3-5 minutes).",
    "Add 1/2 cup chicken stock and a splash of vinegar or lemon juice. Reduce again.",
    "Whisk in 1-2 tsp Dijon mustard and a small knob of butter to finish the sauce.",
    "Taste and adjust - if too sweet, add more acid or salt. Spoon sauce over chicken."
  ],
  "notes": "This recipe uses sweet semi-sparkling wine (Stella Rosa Black Cherry), so balance the sweetness with acid (vinegar or lemon juice) and Dijon mustard. Reduce longer than you would a dry wine to cook off sugar. Avoid adding sugar, honey, or sweet glazes elsewhere in the dish. The sauce also pairs well with pork. For a bolder flavor, add chili flakes or balsamic vinegar to the sauce.",
