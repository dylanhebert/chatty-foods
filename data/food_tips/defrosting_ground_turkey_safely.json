    {"name": "Microwave method (fastest)", "details": "Remove packaging, place on microwave-safe plate. Use defrost setting or 30% power for 2-3 minutes, flipping halfway. Cook immediately after."},
    {"name": "Cold water method (moderate speed)", "details": "Keep turkey in sealed packaging or leak-proof bag. Submerge in cold water, changing water every 30 minutes. Thaws in about 1 hour. Cook right after."},
    {"name": "Fridge method (safest)", "details": "Place in a bowl or tray to catch drips. Leave in fridge overnight (12-24 hours). Can stay in fridge for up to 2 days before cooking."},
    {"name": "Counter defrosting", "details": "Never defrost on the counter - the temperature danger zone promotes bacterial growth."}
  ],
  "notes": "Microwave defrosting is safe as long as you cook immediately afterward. The microwave can cause parts to start cooking while other parts are still frozen, creating a temperature zone where bacteria can multiply if left to sit.",
