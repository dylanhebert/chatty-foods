  "directions": [
    "Microwave the corn (in husk or wrapped) for 4-6 minutes until tender. Let cool slightly, then remove husks and silk.",
    "Heat a skillet, grill pan, or griddle over high heat.",
    "Brush corn lightly with oil or butter and place on the hot pan.",
    "Char each side for 2-3 minutes, rotating every couple minutes until golden-brown spots appear (about 8-10 minutes total).",
    "While corn chars, mix together the mayonnaise, sour cream, lime juice, chili powder, and salt to make the sauce.",
    "Brush or spoon the sauce all over the hot charred corn.",
    "Sprinkle generously with cotija cheese (or feta).",
    "Dust with extra chili powder or Tajin, garnish with chopped cilantro, and squeeze fresh lime over top."
  ],
  "notes": "Can also be made as a street-corn bowl by cutting kernels off the cob and tossing with the sauce, cheese, chili, lime, and cilantro. A flat griddle pan works great for charring if you don't have a grill. Pre-cooking in the microwave speeds things up significantly.",
