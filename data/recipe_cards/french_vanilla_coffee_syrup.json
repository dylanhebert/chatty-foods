  "notes": "French vanilla has a richer, creamier profile than regular vanilla with subtle custard-like notes. The key is using both vanilla bean paste AND vanilla extract. Heavy cream or condensed milk is optional but adds the classic creamy French vanilla character. Great in lattes, cappuccinos, iced coffee, cold brew, and hot chocolate.",
