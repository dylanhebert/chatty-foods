  "directions": [
    "In a small saucepan, combine water, sugar, sliced strawberries, and mint leaves.",
    "Simmer gently for 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Lightly mash the strawberries with a spoon or fork.",
    "Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract and optional lemon juice.",

    "Let cool before bottling. Store in the fridge for 1-2 weeks."

  "notes": "A lightly fruity and refreshing syrup. The vanilla smooths out the edges and gives a slightly creamy, rounded finish. Great in cold brew, iced lattes with milk or cream, sparkling water, lemonade, mojitos, and vodka spritzers. For a stronger berry flavor, use more strawberries.",
