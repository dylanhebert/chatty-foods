    "Make the crumble: In the same pan or a separate one, mix 1 tbsp butter, 2 tbsp flour or oats, and 2 tbsp brown sugar. Stir until golden and smells like cookies. Optionally add salt, cinnamon, or chocolate chips.",
    "Plate and serve: Spoon the warm fruit into a bowl. Top with the crumble.",
    "Mix Greek yogurt with a touch of honey and drizzle over the top. Warm the yogurt slightly if you want it more sauce-like."

  "notes": "For a chocolate version: stir chocolate chips into the warm fruit right after removing from heat, mix cocoa powder into the crumble, or stir melted chocolate/Nutella into the yogurt drizzle. Optional twists: add chopped nuts to the crumble, mix vanilla extract or lemon zest into the fruit while cooking.",
