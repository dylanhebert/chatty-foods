  "portion_count": "1 bottle (about 1 cup)",
  "ingredients": [
    {
      "name": "sugar (or honey)",
      "amount": "1/2 cup"
    },
    {
      "name": "water",
      "amount": "1/2 cup"

    {
      "name": "orange zest",
      "amount": "from 1/2 orange"
    },
    {
      "name": "fresh orange juice",
      "amount": "1 tbsp"
    },
    {
      "name": "vanilla extract",
      "amount": "1/2 tsp"
    }
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Combine sugar and water in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.",
    "Add orange zest and fresh orange juice. Simmer gently for 5-10 minutes to infuse the citrus flavor.",
    "Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract.",
    "Strain through a fine-mesh sieve to remove zest pieces.",
    "Let cool to room temperature before bottling. Store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks."
  ],
  "notes": "Straining is important to prevent zest from clogging syrup dispensers. Orange juice alone is not a sufficient preservative - add 1 tsp lemon juice or 1 tbsp vodka to extend shelf life. For a thicker syrup, use a 2:1 sugar-to-water ratio. Pairs beautifully with Honey Syrup in lattes (2 parts honey to 1 part orange vanilla). Heat to 190-200F but avoid boiling.",
