  "portion_count": "1 bottle (about 1 cup)",
  "ingredients": [
    {
      "name": "honey",
      "amount": "1/2 cup"
    },
    {
      "name": "water",
      "amount": "1/2 cup"

    {
      "name": "vanilla extract",
      "amount": "1/4 tsp"
    },
    {
      "name": "lemon juice (optional)",
      "amount": "1 tsp"
    }
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Combine honey and water in a small saucepan over medium heat.",
    "Stir until honey is fully dissolved. Heat to around 190-200F (just below boiling).",
    "Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract and optional lemon juice.",
    "Let cool to room temperature before bottling.",
    "Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks."
  ],
  "notes": "Use 1/4 tsp vanilla extract for a subtle flavor that won't overpower the honey. Lemon juice cuts through sweetness and acts as a mild preservative. For lattes with a 36g espresso shot, start with 1-2 tbsp of syrup. Pairs well with Orange Vanilla Syrup (2:1 ratio honey to orange vanilla). Add 1 tbsp vodka per cup to extend shelf life. Let cool before refrigerating to avoid condensation.",
