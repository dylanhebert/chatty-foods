    {"name": "Freezer for longer storage", "details": "If storing longer than 2 days, use the freezer instead of the fridge."},
    {"name": "Bring to room temp before baking", "details": "Take the dough out of the fridge while the oven preheats. Let it sit at room temperature for 20-30 minutes to take the chill off. This helps the cookies bake more evenly."}

  "notes": "For short-term storage (1-2 days), the fridge is perfect. The freezer is only necessary for longer storage periods. Always let refrigerated dough warm slightly before baking for best results.",
