  "directions": [
    "Wrap bamboo mat in plastic wrap.",
    "Place nori sheet shiny-side down on the mat.",
    "Spread sushi rice evenly over the nori, leaving a 1-inch strip at the top.",
    "Lay salmon slices and avocado slices across the center of the rice.",
    "Roll tightly using the bamboo mat, tucking the filling as you go.",
    "Wet a sharp knife and slice the roll into 6-8 pieces using a single clean downward motion (do not saw). Wet the knife between each cut."

  "notes": "This is the baseline roll - nail this one first. Use short-grain Japanese sushi rice (Calrose) for best results. Slice salmon cold, right before assembling. Thaw frozen salmon slowly in the fridge for 24 hours before use.",
