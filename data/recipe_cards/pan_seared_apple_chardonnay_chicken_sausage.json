  "directions": [
    "Preheat a nonstick or cast iron pan on medium heat. Add a splash of oil.",
    "Place sausages in the pan whole or sliced into 1/2-inch pieces. Slicing gives more browning surface.",
    "Sear for 4-5 minutes, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides and heated through.",
    "Lower heat to medium-low. Add 1 tbsp butter. Tilt the pan and baste sausages as it melts. Optionally add dried thyme or rosemary at this point.",
    "Turn heat to low. Add 1-2 tbsp of the sriracha BBQ sauce to the pan. Toss or roll sausages in the sauce for about 1 minute to glaze. Do not let it burn.",
    "Kill the heat and serve. Extra sauce can be served on the side for dipping."
  ],
  "notes": "These sausages are fully cooked, so the goal is to brown and heat through. The BBQ sauce should be used as a light glaze at the end, not as a marinade - the sausage already has sweet/smoky flavoring. For a different approach, consider honey mustard glaze, apple cider reduction, or maple-Dijon sauce instead. For butter with sliced sausages, use 1/2 tbsp for 4 sausages or 1 tbsp for 8.",
