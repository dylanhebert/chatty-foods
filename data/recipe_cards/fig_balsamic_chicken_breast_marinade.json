  "directions": [
    "Whisk together fig balsamic vinegar, olive oil, honey, soy sauce, garlic, thyme, Dijon mustard (if using), and black pepper in a bowl.",
    "Reserve 1/3 of the marinade (about 3 tbsp) in a separate container for the pan sauce -- do not let this touch raw chicken.",
    "Pour remaining marinade over chicken breasts in a bowl or bag. Marinate for 30 minutes to 2 hours in the fridge (up to 8 hours for maximum flavor).",
    "Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry for a better sear.",
    "Cook chicken by your preferred method (pan-sear, grill, or oven bake) until internal temperature reaches 165F.",
    "For the sauce: in the same skillet or a saucepan, pour in reserved marinade with a splash of water or white wine (about 2 tbsp).",
    "Bring to a simmer and cook 2-4 minutes until slightly thickened.",
    "Optionally whisk in 1 tsp butter at the end for a glossy finish.",
    "Drizzle sauce over sliced chicken or rice."
  ],
  "notes": "The key technique is reserving 1/3 of the marinade before it touches raw chicken so it can be safely used as a sauce. Pairs well with oven-roasted zucchini and squash, and roasted red potatoes. Pat chicken dry before cooking for the best sear.",
