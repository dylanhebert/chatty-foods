    "Combine mayo and sriracha in a small bowl.",

  "notes": "Kewpie mayo is preferred for its richer, tangier flavor, but regular mayo works fine. This sauce can be drizzled on sushi rolls or used to lightly toss diced salmon for a spicy salmon filling. Makes enough for multiple rolls. This one sauce alone will make homemade sushi feel restaurant-level.",
