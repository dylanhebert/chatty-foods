  "directions": [
    "Dice red potatoes into 1/2-inch chunks (skin on). Microwave or boil for 5-6 minutes until just fork-tender. Drain and let steam off.",
    "In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the ground pork until cooked through. Season with salt, pepper, cumin, smoked paprika, and a bit of oregano. Remove and set aside.",
    "In the same skillet, add a little oil and saute diced white onion until soft. Add chopped peperoncini and a spoonful of the brine to deglaze the pan. Cook 1-2 minutes.",
    "Add the pre-cooked potatoes to the pan. Press them down slightly and let them crisp undisturbed for a few minutes. Stir occasionally until golden.",
    "Return pork to the pan. Mix well and let everything cook together for 3-4 more minutes to blend flavors. Add a splash of hot sauce or mustard if desired.",
    "For the yogurt sauce: mix plain Greek yogurt with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and a bit of olive oil or vinegar.",
    "Plate the pork and potato saute hot. Drizzle with the garlicky yogurt sauce or serve on the side."
  ],
  "notes": "If you like more tang and heat, bump peperoncini up to 1/2 cup. For extra brightness, add a splash of white wine vinegar. Serve with a kale and apple slaw for a complete dinner. You can substitute white wine for vinegar in dressings - just add a squeeze of lemon or splash of peperoncini brine for acidity. Also great served in tortillas as taco filling, or topped with a fried egg.",
