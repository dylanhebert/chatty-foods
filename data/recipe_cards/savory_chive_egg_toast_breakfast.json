  "directions": [
    "Toast the bread. Butter both slices lightly.",
    "Beat eggs with a splash of milk, salt, pepper, and chopped chives.",
    "Cook eggs over medium-low heat in butter, stirring gently for soft, fluffy curds.",
    "Assemble savory toast: spoon scrambled eggs onto one slice of buttered toast. Drizzle with hot sauce.",
    "Assemble sweet toast: spread fruit preserves on the second slice of buttered toast.",
    "Prepare yogurt side: layer Greek yogurt with fruit and drizzle with honey.",
    "Serve all three components together."
  ],
  "notes": "Split the toast into one savory slice and one sweet slice for contrast. Use vinegar-based hot sauce (Cholula, Crystal, or Tabasco) on the egg toast. Do not put eggs on top of fruit preserves - keep them separate. Optional upgrades: avocado slices under the eggs, cream cheese spread, rub a cut garlic clove on hot toast, everything bagel seasoning, or add granola/nuts/chia seeds to the yogurt.",
