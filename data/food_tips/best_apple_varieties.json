    {"name": "Red Delicious (worst)", "details": "Often considered the worst-tasting apple. Frequently criticized for being bland, mealy (dry, grainy, crumbly texture), and lacking flavor. More popular for appearance than taste."},
    {"name": "Honeycrisp", "details": "Known for crispness and sweet-tart flavor. A favorite for eating fresh."},
    {"name": "Granny Smith", "details": "Very crisp and tart green apple. Great for both eating and baking."},
    {"name": "Fuji", "details": "Sweet and firm with a dense, crisp texture."},
    {"name": "Gala", "details": "Sweet and mildly crisp. Popular choice for snacking."},
    {"name": "Pink Lady", "details": "Firm texture with balanced sweet-tart flavor."}
  ],
  "notes": "'Mealy' means a texture that feels dry, grainy, and crumbly rather than crisp and juicy. To avoid mealy apples, choose Honeycrisp, Granny Smith, Fuji, Gala, or Pink Lady.",
