  "directions": [
    "After cooking your chicken, remove it from the pan (leave the drippings).",
    "Melt 1 tbsp butter in the pan, saute minced garlic for about 30 seconds (don't let it burn).",
    "Deglaze with the white wine, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pan.",
    "Simmer until reduced by about half, 3-5 minutes.",
    "Swirl in the remaining 1 tbsp butter off heat for richness.",
    "Season with salt and pepper, add optional lemon squeeze or fresh herbs.",
    "Spoon sauce over the chicken and serve."
  ],
  "notes": "No need to water down the wine -- it reduces and concentrates flavor as it simmers. The butter swirled in at the end gives the sauce body and a silky finish. For a milder sauce, replace half the wine with chicken stock (1/4 cup stock + 1/4 cup wine). For a punchier garlic flavor, use up to 4 cloves. The wine by itself is the classic approach and balances nicely once the butter is added.",
