  "directions": [
    "Crack eggs into a bowl. Add milk or water if using. Whisk until well blended and slightly frothy. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Place a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add butter or oil and let it melt, tilting the pan to coat the surface.",
    "Pour the eggs into the pan. Let them sit for 30 seconds without stirring.",
    "As the edges start to set, gently push them toward the center with a spatula, tilting the pan to let uncooked egg fill the gaps.",
    "When the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top, sprinkle fillings over half the omelet.",
    "Carefully fold the omelet in half with the spatula.",
    "Let it cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute, just until the inside is cooked and any cheese melts.",
    "Slide the omelet onto a plate and serve immediately."
  ],
  "notes": "Use medium heat to avoid browning the eggs too much. The goal is a soft, yellow omelet. Common filling combinations: cheese and ham, mushroom and spinach, or bell peppers and onions.",
