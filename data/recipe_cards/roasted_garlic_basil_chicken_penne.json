  "directions": [
    "Cook pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook penne until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain.",
    "Marinate chicken: Combine chicken breast with the roasted garlic marinade, half the lime juice, salt, and pepper. Let sit 15-20 minutes.",
    "Sear chicken: Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high. Shake excess marinade off the chicken and sear 3-4 minutes per side until golden and cooked through (165F internal). Remove to a plate and slice.",
    "Cook onions: Add remaining 1 tbsp olive oil to the skillet. Add sliced onion and the white/light green parts of the green onions. Cook until softened and lightly caramelized, about 5 minutes.",
    "Build the sauce: Add any leftover marinade plus 1/2 cup pasta water to deglaze, scraping up browned bits. Let simmer 1-2 minutes. For creamy version, add 1 cup half-and-half here and simmer 1-2 minutes to thicken.",
    "Combine: Add drained pasta and sliced chicken to the skillet. Toss to coat, adding more pasta water a splash at a time until the sauce clings to the pasta.",
    "Finish: Turn off the heat, stir in basil, remaining lime juice, and dark green tops of the green onions. Taste and adjust seasoning.",
    "Serve: Top with Parmesan if desired. Serve hot. Refrigerate leftovers up to 4 days."
  ],
  "notes": "Penne is recommended over elbows because the tube shape traps more sauce. Use green onion whites/light parts during cooking and reserve the dark green tops for garnish. For a creamy garlic-basil version, add 1 cup half-and-half when building the sauce. Pound chicken to even thickness for uniform cooking. Originally developed around Garlic Festival brand roasted garlic sauce, but any roasted garlic marinade would work.",
