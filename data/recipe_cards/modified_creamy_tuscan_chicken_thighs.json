  "notes": "Adapted from a Creamy Tuscan Chicken recipe, substituting capers for sun-dried tomatoes, onion powder for shallot, and omitting spinach. Capers provide the same salty punch but brighter flavor. Fresh herbs (thyme and rosemary) should bloom in fat during the sauce step, not applied to raw chicken, to avoid burning. Serve with roasted zucchini/squash (425F, 15-20 min) and roasted frozen potatoes (425-450F, 25-35 min). Plate with potatoes as base, chicken and sauce over top, veggies on the side.",
