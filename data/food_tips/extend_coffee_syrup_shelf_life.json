  "notes": "If selling at a farmers market in Texas, syrups must be shelf-stable under the Texas Cottage Food Law. Lower pH to below 4.6 using citric acid, lemon juice, or vinegar. Required labeling includes product name, ingredients list, net weight/volume, allergen warnings, your name/address, and the statement: 'This food is made in a home kitchen and is not inspected by the Department of State Health Services or a local health department.' No food handler's license required in Texas, but a food safety course is recommended. A Sales Tax Permit from the Texas Comptroller is needed for taxable items.",
