  "directions": [
    "Preheat oven to 425F.",
    "Toss Brussels sprouts in olive oil, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Add balsamic vinegar now or drizzle after roasting for a glaze-like finish.",
    "Spread cut-side down on a foil- or parchment-lined baking sheet without crowding.",
    "Roast for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until deeply browned and crispy."
  ],
  "notes": "Designed to pair with seasoned chicken wings (chili powder, garlic, oregano). The smoked paprika adds subtle warmth to complement spicy wings. Optional upgrades: sprinkle grated Parmesan in the last 5 minutes of roasting, or add a pinch of chili flakes after baking for extra heat. Can substitute black mission fig balsamic for a nice twist.",
