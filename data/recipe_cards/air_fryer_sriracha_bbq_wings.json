  "directions": [
    "Pat the wings dry with paper towels -- moisture kills crispiness.",
    "Toss wings in the dry rub seasoning (salt, garlic powder, smoked paprika, black pepper, optional cayenne). No oil needed.",
    "Preheat air fryer to 380F.",
    "Air fry at 380F for 24 minutes, flipping halfway through.",
    "For extra crispiness, increase to 400F for the last 4-5 minutes.",
    "Toss cooked wings in the Sriracha BBQ sauce after air frying.",
    "Optional: Put sauced wings back in the air fryer at 400F for 2-3 minutes to caramelize the glaze."
  ],
  "notes": "Do NOT marinate the wings -- marinades add moisture which prevents crisping in the air fryer. The sugar in the sauce will burn if air fried too long, so always sauce after cooking. Don't overload the basket; crispiness needs airflow. Warm the sauce slightly before tossing for extra sticky wings. Serve with a squeeze of lime or ranch for balance.",
