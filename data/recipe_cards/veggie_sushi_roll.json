    "Lay avocado slices, cucumber strips, and scallion across the center of the rice.",
    "Roll tightly using the bamboo mat, tucking the filling as you go.",

  "notes": "Roll this one first as a warm-up - it is forgiving and builds confidence. Optional additions: thin carrot matchsticks, a small amount of cream cheese, or a very light brush of toasted sesame oil on the rice. Pairs well with soy sauce and wasabi on the side.",
