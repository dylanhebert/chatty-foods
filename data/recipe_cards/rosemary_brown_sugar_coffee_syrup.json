  "portion_count": "1 bottle (about 1 cup)",
  "ingredients": [
    {
      "name": "brown sugar (light or dark)",
      "amount": "1/2 cup"
    },
    {
      "name": "water",
      "amount": "1/2 cup"

    {
      "name": "fresh rosemary sprig (about 4 inches)",
      "amount": "1"
    },
    {
      "name": "vanilla extract (optional)",
      "amount": "1/2 tsp"
    }
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Combine brown sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until sugar fully dissolves.",
    "Add rosemary sprig and simmer gently for 5-10 minutes, depending on desired herb intensity.",
    "Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract if using.",
    "Remove rosemary sprig and strain through a fine-mesh sieve if needed.",
    "Let cool before transferring to a syrup bottle. Store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks."
  ],
  "notes": "If syrup is too runny: simmer longer (2-5 more minutes), add 1-2 tbsp more brown sugar, or add 1 tsp honey/molasses while warm. Syrup will thicken further as it cools. Works great in lattes, cold brew, and Americanos. Optional add-ins: cinnamon stick, orange zest, thyme sprig, or a pinch of nutmeg. For a winter version add cinnamon + clove + orange zest. For a lighter herbal version add thyme + lemon peel.",
