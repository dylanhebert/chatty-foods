  "directions": [
    "Finely chop the kale and massage it with a little oil or vinegar to soften.",

  "notes": "You can substitute regular white wine for the vinegar - use 1 tbsp white wine plus a small squeeze of lemon juice or a splash of peperoncini brine for acidity. Sharp cheddar works well for the cheese. Pairs well with Peperoncini Pork and Potato Saute as a dinner side.",
