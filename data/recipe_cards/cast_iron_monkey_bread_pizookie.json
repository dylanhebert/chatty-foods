    "Stir cinnamon and granulated sugar together in a small bowl. Dip each dough ball into melted butter, then coat in the cinnamon-sugar mix.",
    "Arrange coated dough balls evenly in a greased 8-10 inch cast iron skillet.",
    "Melt the glaze ingredients together (brown sugar + butter + optional vanilla) and drizzle over the top.",
    "Bake for 18-22 minutes until bubbling and golden.",
    "Let cool for 3-5 minutes, then top with scoops of coffee ice cream."

  "notes": "For extra decadence, add chocolate chips between the dough balls before baking. Consider an espresso glaze or caramel drizzle on top. This is a sharing-size version scaled up from the single-serve ramekin recipe.",
