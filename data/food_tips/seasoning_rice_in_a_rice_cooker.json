    {"name": "Add salt before cooking", "details": "Add about 1/2 to 3/4 tsp kosher salt per cup of dry rice to the water before hitting cook. The rice absorbs the seasoned water as it cooks, so the flavor is even throughout."},
    {"name": "Order of operations", "details": "Rice in, water to the correct line, salt into the water, then cook. Give the water a quick swirl if you want, but the salt will dissolve as it heats."},
    {"name": "Skip pepper during cooking", "details": "Pepper gets muddy and bitter when boiled. Add pepper after fluffing, not before cooking."},
    {"name": "Optional upgrades", "details": "Swap part of the water for broth, or add a little butter or oil before cooking for richer rice."},
    {"name": "Firm rule", "details": "Salt before cooking, never after. Fluff at the end, then add extras like butter, pepper, or herbs."}

  "notes": "This applies when transitioning from stovetop rice (where you might season at the end) to a rice cooker. The key difference is that with a rice cooker, seasoning goes in at the start.",
