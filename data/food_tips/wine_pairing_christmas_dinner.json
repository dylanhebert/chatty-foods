    {"name": "Chianti", "details": "Classic Italian pairing. High acidity cuts through tomato sauce and balances pork richness."},
    {"name": "Barbera", "details": "Light tannins and bright acidity make it an easy-drinking red that pairs well with meatballs."},
    {"name": "Zinfandel", "details": "Bold and fruit-forward, handles savory and slightly sweet sauce notes. Can also carry through to dessert."},
    {"name": "Grenache (Garnacha)", "details": "Juicy and peppery without overpowering the dish. Another good all-meal option."},
    {"name": "Verdicchio (white option)", "details": "Crisp and refreshing with citrusy profile that balances tomato sauce."},
    {"name": "Pinot Grigio (white option)", "details": "Light, acidic, and simple. Works as a refreshing contrast."},
    {"name": "Unoaked Chardonnay (white option)", "details": "Lighter version handles pork without clashing with tomato."},
    {"name": "Moscato d'Asti (dessert pairing)", "details": "Sweet, lightly sparkling, and festive. Perfect for cookies without being too heavy."},
    {"name": "Prosecco (dessert pairing)", "details": "Dry or off-dry keeps things light and bubbly. Pairs well with sugar cookies or buttery treats."},
    {"name": "Port or Tawny Port (dessert pairing)", "details": "Rich and sweet, ideal if cookies are chocolatey or nutty."}

  "notes": "Meal: Spaghetti with pork meatballs followed by Christmas cookies. For one wine all meal, choose Zinfandel or Grenache. For two wines, pair Chianti or Barbera with the main course and Moscato for dessert.",
