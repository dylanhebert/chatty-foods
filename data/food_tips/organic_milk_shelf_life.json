    {"name": "Ultra-pasteurization process", "details": "Organic milk is heated to about 280F (138C) for 2-4 seconds, killing virtually all bacteria and significantly extending shelf life compared to regular pasteurization (161F for 15 seconds)."},
    {"name": "Distribution needs", "details": "Organic milk is often distributed nationwide, so ultra-pasteurization ensures it stays fresh during longer transportation and storage."},
    {"name": "Packaging", "details": "Usually designed to be airtight and light-resistant, further preserving the milk."},
    {"name": "Nutritional differences", "details": "Ultra-pasteurization can slightly reduce heat-sensitive vitamins (B12, folate), but losses are minimal. May cause a slightly 'cooked' flavor."},
    {"name": "Why non-organic milk isn't ultra-pasteurized", "details": "Non-organic milk has shorter, more local distribution chains. Consumers prefer the fresher taste of regular pasteurization, and ultra-pasteurization equipment costs more."}
  ],
  "notes": "Both ultra-pasteurized and regularly pasteurized milk are safe and healthy. Choose ultra-pasteurized for longer shelf life and convenience, or regular pasteurized for fresher taste and minimal processing.",
